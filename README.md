Additively Manufactured Helping Hands

## Stated Requirement
Wanted to solder two wires together. Did not have helping hands, and disliked jury rigged solutions. Searched for printable products and found almost none without comically unacceptable design flaws.

## Goal
It is the goal of this project to explore the design of "helping hands" which may aid in the soldering of electronic components.

## Style Guidelines
* All parts should be printable with no support material whatsoever.
* Bridging of any kind is unnaceptable.
* Parts ought be functional over as wide a range of infills and shell thicknesses as possible.
* Parts ought use as little fillament as neccesary.
* Absolutely no non-printed parts may be used, as this violates core rep-rap philosophy.
* Excessive drafts should be avoided.
* No print in place components which require material failure to achieve opearation are acceptable.
* Parts that would tend to separate from the printbed ought have designed thermoelastic compliance taken into account.
* Problems that can be anticipated in design, must be taken into account. Should the need to post "reccomend print settings" arise, then the design is sub-optimal.
* It should be extremely difficult to break any of these parts with human hands while attempting normal use. For example, nuts should never be large enough to permit shearing by human hands of normal strength, and ergonomics ought be taken into account whenever possible so that the motivation to use external tools such as pliers and wrenches ought never occur.
* Design ought be driven by engineering principles and algebra, with assumptions and considerations including
    - Thermo-elastic structural analysis
    - Design for structural dynamics and no more than 2% critical damping at the first harmonic
    - An assumed grip strength of 100 lbf.
    - A friction coeficient of .3, with amplification factors of either 0.5 or 2.0, whichever is more conservative for the specific analysis situation.
